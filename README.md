# StudioChat
Powershell-Core Multi-Window Chatbot with LM Studio hosted model(s). 

### DEVELOPMENT NOTES..
So far it works, but is limited, after upgrades below, there will be a review, the plan from here is...

1. Multi-Line Input via re-formatting text inputted, ensuring to replace, blank lines and new lines with "/n", then inputting in one line.
2. format of window should include borders, and re-draw, displaying, "current" and "recent" and "so-far", events, these will have to be consolidated by the model additionally.
3. Prompt Sent to AI with insertion of consolidated interactions in, current and recent and so-far, sections.
